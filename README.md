# Sentiment Analysis with LSTM

A deep learning project that classifies movie reviews as positive or negative using recurrent neural networks.

## Overview
This project uses the IMDB movie reviews dataset to train and evaluate sentiment classification models.

## Models Implemented
- Standard RNN
- LSTM
- Bidirectional LSTM

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Evaluation
Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- LSTM Accuracy: ~89%
- BiLSTM Accuracy: ~90%
- RNN Accuracy: ~82%

## What I Learned
- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Designing and tuning recurrent neural networks
- Comparing model architectures on real-world data
